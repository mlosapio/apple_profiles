## DEF CON iOS Burner profile

What do you do when you don't have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on an MDM solution and need to keep your 
wife off the notorious DEF CON Wall-of-Sheep?

Well there's never a shortage of old iOS devices in my house so finding a sacraficial lamb as the "Burner Device" for my wife 
is pretty darn easy. You can also pick one up on ebay pretty easily. 

Note: You will _always_ want to ensure you're using a phone that is currently supported by Apple and _at-least_ an iphone 5s which includes
the secure enclave (read the iOS whitepaper). 

I've thrown together this iOS profile which can be loaded directly from visting the RAW file from github *or* you can pull down this file
and download yourself a copy of Apple's Configurator 2 software and load this profile onto the device you're taking. 

Basically it should keep Bluetooth off, wifi off, off iCloud, a strong password to unlock the phone and strict "nuke" options should
it fall into the wrong hands. 


Another important note, once you've designated this device as a "burner device" and visited DEF CON - toss the phone, sell it on eBay or wipe it. Just don't ever reconnect it back to a computer you care about. 

Best of luck!
